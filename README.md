# FFT
A signal can be processed with FFT using block by block (or frame by frame) method to determine frequencies present. The matlab file includes a sample of code that will process a signal using a set frame size, apply FFT and then create a crude time-frequency plot (because no toolboxes could be used for this project). The appropriate file name will need to be inputted for use of audioread().
Originally this code was used to determine a sequence of digits within a signal via comparison to DTMF. This part has been removed to make the code more general in application.
