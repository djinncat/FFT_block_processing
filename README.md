# FFT
A signal can be processed with FFT using block by block (or frame by frame) method to determine frequencies present. The matlab file includes a sample of code that will process a signal using a set frame size, apply FFT and then create a crude time-frequency plot (because no toolboxes could be used for this project). The appropriate file name will need to be inputted for use of audioread().
